# SCP - Perception

Cancelled "game", more like prototype, that I had a bunch of fun working on in mid 2019. Basically a more enhanced version of my [Godot - 2D Horror Demo](https://github.com/NuclearPhoenixx/Godot-Horror-Demo-2D)

I had no real story or gameplay concept (no vision), but I essentially wanted to experiment with how a horror game like SCP Containment breach could work in a 2D top-down game.
I also had no fu**ing clue what I was doing since I had next to no prior experience in Godot or any other game engine whatsoever.
However, I learned a bunch of things, I had fun doing it and also learned a lot of things. And I still quite like the top down view with the shadows and the restricted FOV.

I used git to keep track of the project, so the whole source code has been rotting on GitHub for about half a decade in some private repo.
It's been done with Godot 3.5 (4.x wasn't nowhere near done back then), so most of the things are already pretty outdated.
However, if anyone wants to have a look at the source code, feel free to use it: I also exported some binaries if you just want to have a look and try this thing out for yourself.
If you run into any issues, feel free to ignore them. I won't be updating them anymore :D (if you really want to fix anything still feel free to open a PR).
